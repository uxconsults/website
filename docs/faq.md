# UxConsults text marketing FAQ

## How does text marketing work?

UxConsults turns appointments into money.

You give us a list of about 100 to 2000 existing customers (any more than that
will probably pull in too many leads). We write an outreach
program using text messaging, and our AI contacts your customers.
If they express an interest, you schedule appointments with them.

## How does the free trial work? What's the catch?

The free trial works like this. You give us a list of 100 names and phone numbers.
We work out a text sequence with you, then we turn on the campaign. If it works, 
you keep all the money from the appointments, and we hope that will convince 
you to use our service again. No contract, no promises, no sales pitch, 
no charges of any kind. It's that
simple. There is literally no catch.

## How much does it cost after the free trial?

Maybe that's the catch? We can't tell a price until we've discussed your business with you
in more detail, but remember, **you get to try it free with no obligation and no sales pitch**.
Once you've decided you like it, we optimize the text system, learn about your
per customer value, and find out what other services you need to maximize profits.

## What kind of business does this work for?

UxConsults text marketing works for *existing* businesses with an *existing customer list* that
includes names and phone numbers. We reactivate existing customers, so obvious
examples include physicians, dentists, service businesses, chiropractors, 
housecleaning companies, handyman services, HVAC firms (for annual service), contractors, medspas, 
financial planners, etc.

## What kind of business will this NOT work for?

Since UxConsults is about customer reactivation, it won't work with a new business.
It's oriented towards businesses with an existing customer list in some sort of
database form. Your business should have about 100 existing customers in its database.

## Doesn't this annoy people?

No, currently text messaging tends to be the preferred way for people to get updates
from businesses they like. Studies show that younger people simply don't like to talk 
on the phone to vendors, but do have a high response rate to text messaging. They
tend to feel that text is a less confrontational medium and prefer to answer on their
own time.
