### WEATHER

Tomorrow's high will be 75°, and the low will be 45°.
Chances of precipitation are good, so be ready to,
you know, precipitate in late afternoon.

### EVENTS

City Center will be holding a jobs fair from 8am-5pm.
Which is kind of odd if you think about it.
What if you want to go after work because
you're looking for a better job?
