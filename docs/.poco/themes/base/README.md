# Base theme

It doesn't look special, but that's the point. Base supports the
entire set of theme framework features:

* Header (optional)
* Nav (optional)
* Aside (optional)
* Support for asides on either left or right
* Footer (optional)
* Mobile suppoort (below certain screen dimensions fonts get bigger
and page layout elements such as aside, nav and footer disappear, 
depending on how limited screen real estate gets)
* Full support even low-end browsers; Javascript is optional


It's easy to customize with minimal additions to CSS.
