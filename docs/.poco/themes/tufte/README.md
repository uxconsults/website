# Tufte

This gorgeous theme is derived from [Tufte CSS](https://edwardtufte.github.io/tufte-css/),
and it's pure [Tufte](https://www.edwardtufte.com).
Mad props to originator [Dave Liepmann](https://www.daveliepmann.com), who later
to the Tufte ecosystem.

This is an example of a classless theme, to which we
added a minimal layout file to support layout elements:
header, nav, and aside
