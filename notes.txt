## Building the site with poco

# This builds a website in the docs directory 
# (last part of command line) using docs as
# the root directory (instead of website), so
# Jekyll and GitHub can use it. 
# The -root docs option indicates the place
# to look for the root index.md file is not
# the current directory (website) but is in
# the ./docs directory, which Jekyll expects it.
# The -webroot docs/WWW option indicates the
# output website goes in that directory.
$ poco -root docs -webroot docs/WWW docs
